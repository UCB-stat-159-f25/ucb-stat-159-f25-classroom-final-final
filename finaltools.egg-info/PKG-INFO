# Final Project: Representation and Archetypes in Fictional Media

This project uses data from the [Open Psychometrics "Which Character" Quiz](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/documentation/) to explore character types (and archetypes) in fictional media. Here is how to navigate this repository:

### Notebooks
There are four notebooks:
1. `1-intro_exploration.ipynb`provides an introduction to the data, cleans it, and explores it.
2. `2-finding_associations.ipynb` examines specific demographic characteristics of fictional characters.
3. `3-identify_archtypes.ipynb`employs multiple dimension reduction and data clustering techniques to make sense of the full scope of the data.
4. `main.ipynb` offers a narrative overview of this work.

### Data
If you're curious about the data, it can all be found in the `data` directory, along with a codebook that explains the online quiz that provided this data.

### Visualizations
All visualizations produced by the notebooks are stored in the `visualizations` directory.

This work is inspired by the [Vermont Computational Story Lab](https://compstorylab.org/archetypometrics/).
