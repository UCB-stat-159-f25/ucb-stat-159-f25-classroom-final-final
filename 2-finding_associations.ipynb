    "# Part 2: Finding Associations\n",
    "In Part 1, we started looking at some trends in the data. There are fun associations that fans would likely find amusing or obvious. But there are also associations that may suggest deeper cultural norms about how certain categories of people are depicted in fiction. In this section, we look at four dimensions that speak to important demographic categories: `straight_queer`, `young_old`, `masculine_feminine`, and `rich_poor`. It is important to note that, by categorizing characters based on respondents' ratings on these dimensions, we are assessing how _perceptions_ of these categories are related to _perceptions_ of other dimensions."
