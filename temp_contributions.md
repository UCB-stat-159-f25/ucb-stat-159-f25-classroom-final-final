I worked primarily on `1-intro_exploration.ipynb` notebook where I used the cleaned data from Peter to conduct EDA charts on the data and explore correlations. I further explored correlations while working on `2-finding-associations.ipynb` as well to create a correlation map with the selected BAP features. I modularized some of the code I used for eda in functions so it would be easier for my team to create modules. I also saved all the visualizations in the visualizations folder and the processed data in the data folder separately for easy in reusability throughout the notebooks. Moreover, I worked on updating the environment.yml file based on the imports I used and tested that the environment works with the notebooks I worked on so far.
